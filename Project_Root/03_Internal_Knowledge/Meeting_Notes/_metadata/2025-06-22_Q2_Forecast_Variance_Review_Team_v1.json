  "summary": "The document summarizes a meeting where the team reviewed the forecasting accuracy for Q2. Significant variances were identified in the northeast region, primarily due to delayed supplier shipments. Recommendations were made to adjust Q3 baselines and increase buffer stock by 12% for high-variance SKUs. Additionally, a further review of vendor performance was suggested to address these issues.",
