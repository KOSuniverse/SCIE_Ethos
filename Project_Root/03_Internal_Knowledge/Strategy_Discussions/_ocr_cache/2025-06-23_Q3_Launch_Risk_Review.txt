Executive Summary:
The Q3 launch presents several operational and market-based risks.
Primary concerns include supply chain delays due to overseas component dependencies,
regulatory review timelines, and potential overlap with competitor product announcements.
Mitigation strategies proposed involve increasing pre-launch inventory buffers,
establishing parallel approval tracks, and executing a staggered regional rollout.
All recommendations aim to reduce launch failure probability and preserve market positioning.
