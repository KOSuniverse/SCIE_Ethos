for the year to 31 December 2024

The directors present their strategic report for the Company and Group for the year to 31 December 2024.
Principal activities

Ethos Energy Group Limited is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Scotland, with its
registered office at EthosEnergy Kirkhill Drive, Kirkhill Industrial Estate, Dyce, Aberdeen AB21 OEU. The Group also
has a corporate office at 3100 S Sam Houston Pkwy, E Houston, TX 77047.

EthosEnergy is a leading independent global service provider of rotating equipment services and solutions to the
power, oi] & gas and industrial markets. The key services include power plant engineering, procurement and
construction; facility operations and maintenance; equipment repair, overhaul, upgrade and life extension; and
project decommissioning.

Employing nearly 3,500 people and serving custamers in over 75 countries, the Group is focused on materially
increasing the life cycle value of customers’ assets. The business has depth and experience in asset management
and long-term maintenance agreements, whilst offering transactional, factory-based parts and repair services
across all industry sectors.

Results

The Group recorded an operating profit of $52.4m (excluding non-recurring expenses as set out in note 5), which
is compared to the operating profit of $44.2m in the previous year. The profit after taxation of the Group for the

year to 31 December 2024 amounted to $14.5m compared to the previous year to 31 December 2023, when the

profit after taxation amounted to $27.4m.

Review of business

The Group provides repair, maintenance, and overhaul services for energy assets such as gas turbines, steam
turbines, generators, compressors and transformers used in the Power Generation, Industrial and Oil & Gas
sectors.

Financial performance improved from prior years as the collective business generated record profits for 2024,
mainly due to product mix and improved margins. Net revenues grew 9% and the company achieved new orders
within the year of $1bn, a record intake. EBITDA (excluding non-recurring expenses and the impact of IFRS 16)
improved $11.7m or 23% on stronger activity, higher gross profit margins and lower selling, general and
administrative costs (SG&A).

The A&D (Aerospace & Defence) segment and OS (Optimisation Solutions) posted record performance while
O&M was flat due to increase operating costs related to the start-up of the Performance Centre.

Our Top 10 customers accounted far 32.7% of total revenue compared to 31.4% in 2023.
The Company is a holding company that provides corporate support and associated services to its members.

Development and Performance of the business
Growth is expected in 2025 due to similar backlog as 2024 with revenue expected to increase further and demand

for our products and services within the market. This gives the directors confidence that performances and
margins will continue to improve.

Strategic Report (continued)
for the year to 31 December 2024

Post acquisition future

At year end, Wood Group PLC and Siemens Energy Global Gmbh & Co. Kg completed the sale of EthosEnergy to
OEP IX GP LLC fund. CEP are a US equity company which has identified that EthosEnergy are well positioned to
meet the growing maintenance needs of an aging turbine fleet and will work with the strong management team
to accelerate the Group’s growth in a growing market, which is benefitting from several trends including adoption
of electric vehicles, electrification of heat and other industrial functions, increasing data centre demands and a
growing demand of intermittent renewable capacity that relies on dispatchable gas power to stabilize grids.

Principal risks and uncertainties

e Failure to deliver expected operational performance could lead to work having to be repeated or liability
claims.
The Group has detailed execution plans and quality programmes for all key contracts supported by close
monitoring and reporting of progress to senior management.

e Contracts where inappropriate pricing, misalignment of contract terms, or failure to comply with contractual
conditions could lead to poor financial performance.
There are robust tried and tested processes and procedures in place covering the review and approval of
contract pricing, the scope of the contract and the management of risk both in the tendering and execution
phases of the contract which are aligned to formal delegations of authority.

e The Group holds inventory and equipment with a view to resale or use within contracts which, if not
ultimately sold, may mean that there is an overstatement in the valuation of inventory.
The control of inventory is an integral part of the business and management monitor its components Closely
in conjunction with forecasts and supply lead times.

e The Group has some contracts where the profit is recognized subject to management estimation and
assumptions, which if applied inconsistently could result in misrepresentation of contract profits and due to
the geographic spread of the customer and supplier base the Group has exposure to foreign exchange risks.
There are Group wide financial processes in place for managing risk in accounting, treasury, tax and capital
expenditure backed by internal audit and quarterly and annual financial risk self-assessments. These
contracts are subject to bi-annual or annual contract review meetings. This is complimented by regular
budgeting and forecasting processes.

War in Ukraine

The current ongoing war in Ukraine has impacted financial markets throughout the world including the industries
that the Group operates in. The Group have looked to manage this impact and currently have minimal activities in
Russia and Belarus. The war is part of the reason for high inflation across the world with prices increasing
substantially in the year and the Group are looking into ways to manage the exposure of inflation risk to the
business.
