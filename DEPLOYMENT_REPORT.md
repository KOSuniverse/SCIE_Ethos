## üéØ MASTER INSTRUCTIONS AS SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

### **Unified Routing Architecture:**
All system routing now flows through `prompts/instructions_master.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 2.0
intent_routing:
  comparison:
    priority: 1  # Highest priority
    ui_integration: true
    route_to: "phase3_comparison.comparison_utils.compare_wip_aging"
    
tool_registry:
  compare_files:
    description: "Compare files using same engine as UI multi-select"
    
quality_protocol:
  kb_retrieval:
    minimum_k: 4
    confidence_scoring: "ravc"
```

### **Integration Points:**
- **Orchestrator:** Loads master instructions at startup
- **Tools Runtime:** Uses master instructions tool registry
- **Main App:** Follows master instructions UI policies
- **Quality System:** Implements master instructions protocols
