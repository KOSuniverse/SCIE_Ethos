# Merged instructions_master.yaml
# Generated: 2025-08-15T22:40:04Z
# Notes:
# - This file merges your uploaded instructions_master.yaml with the expanded end-state spec discussed.
# - Additions include: predictive_modeling as a first-class capability, richer routing/metadata assumptions,
#   dual-pass verification and confidence scoring, stricter abstention/citation rules, multilingual alias hints,
#   and explicit forecasting policy math (Par/ROP/SS) with horizon support (e.g., Q2-2026).
# - The "routing.normalizers" block includes country normalization and a one-shot clarifier policy.
# - The "logging_and_audit" block defines per-turn fields for S3 logs to support SOX-lite auditing.
# - Retrieval defaults use tight top-k (4 + 6 backup) and abstain if similarity falls below threshold.
